### Building regional community
OU & OSU working together, instructor exchanges, running marquee events like
ResBaz together.


### Outreach to underrepresented areas
@Dana, some plans for running workshops at places like Langston and other
underserved locations.

### Libraries
Libraries are transitioning to become facilities that enable just these kinds
of activities and collaborations. @carl, more from you here.


### It is more than just workshops
Talk about how this is about a new mode for peer learning and teaching, and how
it goes beyond just "training".
