The Carpentries are two closely affiliated non-profit organizations, Software Carpentry (SWC) & Data Carpentry (DC), that both coordinate collective efforts to spread the skills necessary for data-driven research. DC delivers domain-specific hands-on intensive workshops covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. Current workshops are designed for people with little to no prior computational experience. These workshops include data organization and cleaning, data management and scripting for data analysis and visualization to empower researchers to work more effectively and reproducibly with data [Data Carpentry 2016]. SWC focuses on common approaches for automating repetitive tasks, data management, defensive programming, source control, and code execution environments[Software Carpentry 2016b]. These workshops use active learning to give learners the opportunity to try the skills and gain immediate feedback with high student-teacher and helper ratios, guided and independent exercises and an interactive and friendly environment for learning [Teal 2015]. Combined, these workshops provide a strong opportunity to learn and the needed conceptual framework for participants to excel in data-driven research [Sandve, et al. 2013; Osborne et al., 2014]. Both organizations share a common network of instructors who are themselves researchers and have expressed significant career benefits from volunteering to teach workshops [Duckles 2016].
